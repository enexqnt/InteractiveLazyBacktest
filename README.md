# InteractiveLazyBacktest

Interactive backtest and Monte Carlo simulation for lazy portfolios (currently in development).

You run the project via [this link](https://enexqnt-interactivelazybacktest-web-13fjcw.streamlitapp.com/)

## Roadmap:

 * [x] Historical Returns
 * [x] Basic Monte Carlo
 * [X] Drawdowns lenght
 * [X] Historical Sharpe ratio
 * [ ] Robust covariance estimation methods
 * [ ] Pre-defined lazy portfolios
 * [ ] Historical Sortino ratio
 * [ ] Simulated efficient frontier
 * [ ] Improve GUI and functionality
